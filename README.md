# Next.js Minimal Starter

This is a lightweight and unbloated starter template for building Next.js applications. It comes with TailwindCSS and Heroicons preinstalled.

## Getting Started

To create a new Next.js project using this starter template, follow these steps:

1. **Create a New Project**

   Use `npx` to create a new Next.js application with this template:

   ```bash
   npx create-next-app@latest your-app-name --use-pnpm --example "https://github.com/rezekiz/nextjs-minimal"
   ```

   Replace `your-app-name` with the name you want for your new project.


2. **Navigate to Your Project Directory**

   ```bash
   cd your-app-name
   ```

3. **Run the Development Server**

   Start the development server with:

   ```bash
   pnpm run dev
   ```

   Your application will be running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Configuration

You can customize TailwindCSS and Heroicons as per your needs. Configuration files for both TailwindCSS and Heroicons are included in the project.

- **TailwindCSS**: Configuration file is located at `tailwind.config.js`.
- **Heroicons**: SVG icons can be used directly in your components or pages.

## Deployment

For deploying your application, you can follow the [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for guidance on various platforms such as Vercel, Netlify, or others.
